Libraries used to create our models: 

sklearn : 	library used to appy linear regression and svm on our dataset. 
		This library also offers tool to analyse our result later on and to use grid search and cross validation to obtain better results 
		https://scikit-learn.org/stable/. 

tensorflow : 	Tensorflow is an open source library that allow us to build and to train ML model. 
		https://www.tensorflow.org/

keras : 	Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. We use it for our LSTM model

transformers: Library to use huggingface transformers https://github.com/huggingface/transformers

Library for useful tools :

numpy and pandas: needs no explanation

random : 	used to get a specific seed for our programs.
		https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html	

pickle : 	library used to save and load some data :
		https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html


nltk : 		is the Natural Language Toolkit and is used for lemmatization : 
		https://www.nltk.org/

matplotlib : 	used to plot the results 
		https://matplotlib.org/
